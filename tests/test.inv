-- undefined lists
there is nothing *(nothing)*

-- adjacent lists
color: mazarine | cochineal
piece: scarf | hat | cloak | coat
a (color) (piece), to keep warm.

-- identification of literals
-- handling of significant whitespace
literals: (x) 1 | (x)(x)   2 xs    | (x)(x)(x) 3 xs, even    -- spaces trail
literals are handled correctly *(literals)*

-- escaping characters (automatically where possible)
-- double dash can be used as an em-dash if there is no space after it
some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little
a literal with something special: a colon

-- empty list items
blanks: (nothing) | something
catch anything? *(blanks)*

-- recursive defs
lr: x(lr) | x
rr: x | x(rr)
astar: a(astar) | (nothing)
p: \((p)\) | \(\) -- the language of matched parens
x+ (lr)
x+ (rr)

-- resolutions fix the evaluation
h <- a (color) (piece), to keep warm.
a - (h)
a - (h) -- will be the same as above
-- redefining h may yield a new evaluation
h <- a (color) (piece), to keep warm.
b - (h)
b - (h)

-- resolution goes through nested defs
_1: 1 (_2) | I (_2) | X (_2)
_2: 2 (_3) | II (_3) | XX (_3)
_3: 3 (_4) | III (_4) | XXX (_4)
_4: 4 (_5) | IV (_5) | XXXX (_5)
_5: 5 | V | XXXXX

seq <- (_1)
b - (seq)
b - (seq)

-- escape characters
this is how you would call a list: \(a\) \nand this goes to a new line

-- line breaks. leading whitespace is not significant
it is sometimes necessary \
        to break long lines

-- indentation. leading whitespace is not significant
  this should not show as indented!     \
  and this is on the same line, but with sig. space \
  after 'indented!'.

-- unicode characters are ignored (not lexed)
Du thé, s'il vous plaît.

-- easily express the infinite!
-- i: (i)
-- (i)

-- list style definitions
-- one item per line, ended with a blank line
-- indentation doesn't matter
-- optional rule to close
-- comments inside items OK

col
------
maz -- a blue
coc
        ind
    tar
vir
------ this is optional

colors - (col), (col), (col), (col), etc.

nonny
----- anything or nothing can go here
a bold (_1)
a super (_5) \
        (_4)
-- \ still works to wrap lines, and comment lines can intervene
if this is printed with an n in front, then comment lines can intervene

n - (nonny)
n - (nonny)
n - (nonny)

-- formatted table style definitions

shipwr
======
a formatted        -- and has trailing white space
entry doesn't require   
one to use backslash to break lines     
-----
another entry, (col) in hue
-----
close with two blanks, a double rule, or a rule
=====

s - (shipwr)
s - (shipwr)
s - (shipwr)

noclose
=======
a 
literal
table
-------
i just checked and only one entry works too

ruleclose
=========
a
(col)
table
--------
i JUST checked and only one entry works too
--------

nc - (noclose)
rc - (ruleclose)


no spaces in names
==================
this should get printed as a literal
------------------------------------
and so should this
