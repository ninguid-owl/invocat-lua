-- undefined lists
there is nothing *(nothing)*

-- adjacent lists
color: mazarine | cochineal
piece: scarf | hat
a (color) (piece), to keep warm.

-- identification of literals
-- handling of significant whitespace
literals: (x) 1 | (x)(x)   2 xs    | (x)(x)(x) 3 xs, even    -- spaces trail
literals are handled correctly *(literals)*

-- escaping characters (automatically where possible)

-- holds fix the evaluation
h <- a (color) (piece), to keep warm.

(h) -- will be the same as above
-- redefining h may yield a new evaluation
h <- a (color) (piece), to keep warm.

-- escape characters
a: this is how you would call a list: \(a\) \nand this goes to a new line
(a)

-- line breaks. leading whitespace is not significant
b: it is sometimes necessary \
        to break long lines
(b)

-- indentation. leading whitespace is not significant
  this should not show as indented!     \
  and this is on the same line, but with sig. space \
  after 'indented!'.

-- double dash can be used as an em-dash if there is no space after it
d: Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little
