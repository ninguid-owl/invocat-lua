-- escape characters
a: this is how you would call a list: \(a\) \nand this goes to a new line
(a)

-- line breaks. leading whitespace is not significant
b: it is sometimes necessary \
        to break long lines
(b)

-- indentation. leading whitespace is not significant
  this should not show as indented!     \
  and this is on the same line, but with sig. space \
  after 'indented!'.

-- double dash can be used as an em-dash if there is no space after it
d: Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little
(d)
